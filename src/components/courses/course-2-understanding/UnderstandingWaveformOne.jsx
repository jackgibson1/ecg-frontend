              Each individual leadâ€™s ECG recording is slightly <b>different in shape.</b>
              This is because each lead is recording the electrical activity of the
              heart from a different direction (a.k.a viewpoint).

              Each deflection (a.k.a. wave) on the ECG represents the <b>average direction</b> of
              electrical travel (which is calculated using mathematical formulae by the
              ECG machine).

              Since the direction of atrial depolarization is almost exactly parallel to the axis
              of lead II (which is from RA to LL), a positive-going deflection (P wave) would
              result in that lead.
